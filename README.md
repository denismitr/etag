# Laravel Etag Middleware for JSON APIs
This a middleware specifically for the Laravel framework and __RESTful APIs__ build with it.
It hashaes the response content and adds it to ETag header of HTTP response.
Then it listenes to __If-Match__ and __If-Not-Match__ headers of the requests that expect to
receive json in response in order to see if a new content needs to be delivered or just 304 Not Modified response is sufficient.
